# TheDevGuide

The world of computer science is vast and intimidating especially for a newbie developer, that is why the IIIT-Bh Programming Society has compiled this list of resources for you (1st years) so that you can explore different domains and technologies that this world of Computer Science has to offer and learn from the best resources that exists out there on the web.

**Note:** Each category might have links to several resources which some may find intimidating but keep in mind that you only have to choose only one resource (which suits you best) from each category to learn that tool or technology.
